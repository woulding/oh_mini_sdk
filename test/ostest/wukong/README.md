# wukong
## Introduction

OpenHarmony stability testing automation tool simulates disorderly user behavior to stress test the stability of OpenHarmony systems and applications.<br>

wukong component architecture diagram<br>
![架构图](figures/wukongArchitectureDiagram.png)<br>

Submodule responsibilities within the component：<br>
1. Command line parsing: allows you to obtain and parse parameters on the command line.<br>
2. Running environment management: Initialize the overall wukong running environment according to the command line.<br>
3. System interface management: Check and get the specified mgr, register controller and dfx faultlog callback functions.<br>
4. Random event generation: Generate a random sequence with a specified number of seeds through the random function to generate events.<br>
5. Event injection: Inject events into the system based on supported event types, relying on subsystems such as Windows, multimode, and security.<br>
6. Exception capture and processing/report generation: The DFX subsystem obtains anomaly information in operation and records logs to generate reports.<br>

## Constraints

1. wukong began presetting after system version 3.2<br>
2. Versions of wukong prior to version 3.2 do not compile with the version. When using wukong, you need to compile and push it to the OpenHarmony device under test. The procedure is as follows：<br>
    2.1. Build a way
    ```
    ./build.sh --product-name rk3568 --build-target wukong
    ```
    2.2. push
    ```
    hdc_std shell mount -o rw,remount /
    hdc_std file send wukong /
    hdc_std shell chmod a+x /wukong
    hdc_std shell mv /wukong /bin/
    ```
