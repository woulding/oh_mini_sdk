/**
 * @brief Implements a timer manager.
 *
 * After a timer is started, users can register several timed events, which
 * can be continuous or one-shot, to it. Some points need to be noticed:\n
 * 1. A timer must be set up (through Setup()) before use, and be shut down
 * (via Shutdown()) before its deconstruction.\n
 * 2. A timer must be set up first and then shut down. Avoid delegating a
 * timer to different threads. Otherwise, multithreading issues may occur.\n
 * 3. Setting up a timer again will not reset the timer, but return
 * `TIMER_ERR_INVALID_VALUE`. If a reset operation is required, shut down
 * the timer first and then set it up.\n
 * 4. The parameter in Shutdown() determines whether the thread in the timer
 * will be detached. A detach operation may cause possible
 * multithreading problems, and is therefore not recommended. If a
 * detach operation is required, availability of related objects used in
 * `thread_` must be guaranteed.
